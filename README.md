## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

Analyzed the dataset: Examined the dataset to understand its structure, checked the overall demographics and identified potential issues like missing values, duplicates and inconsistencies in terms of date formats.

Handled missing values: Used SQL queries to identify columns with missing values (NULL). Finalized on an approach to handle missing values, 
such as deleting rows with missing values, replacing them with appropriate values or imputing values based on certain criteria.

Standardized data formats: Used SQL queries to identify inconsistencies in data formats, such as date formats or categorical values. 
Applied appropriate transformations to standardize the formats and ensure consistency across the dataset.

Applied self-join, COALESCE, substring, charindex, PARSENAME and other functions. 

Validated data integrity: Checked for data integrity issues using SQL constraints or verifying table relationships. 
Ensured that the data follows the defined rules and constraints to maintain data integrity.
